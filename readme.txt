All this does is add in a submenu under the users menu on the admin side for recently registered users.

== Description ==

With this plugin, admins will have a new submenu under the Users menu to list the 25 most recently registered users (in reverse order), pulling down their avatar, based on what you set as default (so identicon, gravatar, etc).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will this work on older versions of WordPress? =

Probably, but I started writing this on v 2.7.1.  Just at a glance, it should work on any 2.x WP at this point. That said, you should ALWAYS upgrade, folks!

= Will this work if I have a special avatar plugin? =

Yes, but it may not show the right avatars. I'd have to know more about those plugins and where they store data before I can answer that.
