All this does is add in a submenu under the users menu on the admin side for recently registered users.

== Description ==

With this plugin, admins will have a new submenu under the Users menu to list the 25 most recently registered users (in reverse order), pulling down their avatar, based on what you set as default (so identicon, gravatar, etc). 

== Installation ==

Put `recently-registered.php` in your plugins directory and activate it.  Nothing else is needed.

== To Do ==

Prettify up the css layout. Right now it's a straight bullet point list, which is a big fugly.  My goal is to make it look like the users.php file, but that's second to making it work.
