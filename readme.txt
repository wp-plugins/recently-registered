All this does is add in a submenu under the users menu on the admin side for recently registered users.

== Description ==

With this plugin, admins will have a new submenu under the Users menu to list the 25 most recently registered users (in reverse order), pulling down their avatar, based on what you set as default (so identicon, gravatar, etc). 

= Version 1.0 =
**01 May, 2009**

* Removed the since code (it wasn't working) and replaced with a short date.

= Version 0.2 =
**30 March, 2009**

* Moved to a sub-folder
* Formatting the list to be nicer.

= Version 0.1 =
**27 March, 2009**

* Initial version.

== Installation ==

1. Unpack the *.zip file and extract the `/recently-registered/` folder and the files.
2. Using an FTP program, upload the full `/recently-registered/` folder to your WordPress plugins directory (Example: `/wp-content/plugins/`).
3. Go to **Plugins > Installed** and activate the plugin.
4. Go to **Users > Recently Registered** and see who's new.

== To Do ==

1. Add in a delete user link (have to sort out the nonce stuff for that, and if there was a delete option from a users wp profile, I'd be done).
2. Maybe make the 25 recent users a selectable list. 5, 10 or 25.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will this work on older versions of WordPress? =

Probably, but I only have v 2.7.1.  Just at a glance, it should work on any 2.x WP at this point.

= Will this work if I have a special avatar plugin? =

Yes, but it may not show the right avatars. I'd have to know more about those plugins and where they store data before I can answer that.
