Initial version.

== Upgrade Notice ==

= 2.0 =
This version is ONLY supported on WordPress 3.1 or higher.

== Installation ==

1. Unpack the *.zip file and extract the `/recently-registered/` folder and the files.
2. Using an FTP program, upload the full `/recently-registered/` folder to your WordPress plugins directory (Example: `/wp-content/plugins/`).
3. Go to Plugins > Installed and activate the plugin.
4. Go to **Users > Recently Registered** and see who's new.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will this work on older versions of WordPress? =

Not anymore.  This ONLY works on WordPress 3.1 and up.

= Does this work on MultiSite? =

Yes, but do *not* use this plugin.  See, this code just activates something that's already there on WordPress MultiSite.  You don't need it!

= Does this work on BuddyPress? =
Yes!

= Why doesn't this check for Stop Forum Spam anymore? =

Overlap.  After a lot of testing, I determiend that [Ban Hammer](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/ban-hammer/) does this better and cleaner.  So if you need that sort of thing, use the right tool.

= Why did you remove the separate page? =

Becuase it was redundant.  If you can sort it all on one page, why not do that?
